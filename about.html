    <p> Due to his Saiyan nature, Goku is initially full of violence and aggression. 
        But after falling into a ravine and hitting his head, which causes him to lose his memory,
         Goku becomes a cheerful, carefree boy. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further 
         influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.
